**Project Title: Generating New Music with Artificial Intelligence**

**Overview:**
In this project, we will harness the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate original music compositions across various genres. Leveraging the open-source framework AudioCraft from Meta AI, we will dive into the realm of AI-based music generation, allowing us to create custom music compositions by providing specific input instructions and fine-tuning the model.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the concepts of AI-based music generation.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for the music generation system.
- Generate music in different genres using AI frameworks.
- Compare and analyze audio outputs generated with different prompts to understand their impact.

**Skills Required:**
- Machine Learning
- AI Frameworks
- Prompt Engineering

**Prerequisites:**
- Proficiency in Python programming.
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts.
- Familiarity with open-source frameworks.
- Basic knowledge of prompt engineering.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- MetaAI
- PyTorch

**Project Description:**
In this project, we will merge technical expertise with creativity to delve into the realm of AI-generated music. By utilizing pretrained AI frameworks, we will embark on a journey to create unique musical compositions. Through interactive Python programs, users will be able to input text descriptions (prompts) specifying musical styles and instruments, and subsequently listen to AI-generated music that aligns with the provided prompts.

We will gain hands-on experience in GUI programming and event handling by developing an intuitive user interface for music generation. This interface will enable users to interact with various components such as text boxes and buttons, connecting seamlessly with Python code to trigger the music generation process.

Furthermore, we will explore the impact of prompts on the quality and diversity of AI-generated music. By experimenting with different prompts, we will uncover the nuances of prompt engineering and its influence on music generation outcomes. Finally, we will compare outputs generated from different prompts, providing insights into the significance of prompt selection in AI-based music composition.
